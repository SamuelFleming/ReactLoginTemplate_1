# ReactLoginTemplate_1
A react application template including a user login functionality for starting React based projects.


Still is a veyr small project I used as a stepping stone to break the back of a larger university project focusing on cloud computing but framed in the context of web dev and containerisation. At the time, my web dev experience was very limited (a couple of postgres data annotation tools implemented for a large data acquisition project) and the project required the building of a app with two major features:
1. User Login 
2. Some form of high CPU process (where cloud scaling would come into play)

I not opnly wanted to get the most of this project Cloud-wise, but also wanted to take the opportunity to get more familiar with web dev, react and other complementary frameworks, and to build an industry-standard app that I was proud of. So I decided that a great way to start would be to create a very simple login app. This app would do just the following:
- have a small array of user objects stored (including unames, passwords and some other stuff)
- the user logs in and the app retieves necesary informatiom.
    - The user can log back out
    - controls for succesful / non-successful log ins (eg: username does not exist, password incorrect etc)

This app was going to include React and Express only.
